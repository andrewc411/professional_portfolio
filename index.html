    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section id="About" class="About"></section>
    <p> My name is Andrew Carroll. I was born on April 11, 1993 in Atlanta, Georgia. I have lived in Atlanta my whole life. I enjoy going hiking, watching movies, and playing video games. I work as a pizza delivery driver for a local pizza and pub in Oakhurst in East Atlanta. I became interested in coding through friends and family. I would love a job with competitive pay that allows me to work remotely. My goal is to complete the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp then find a job that supports my lifestyle while encouraging me to continue to learn more to become a better front end web developer.
