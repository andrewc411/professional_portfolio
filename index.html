    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> My name is Andrew Carroll. I was born in 1993 in Atlanta, Georgia. I have lived in Atlanta my whole life.
        I enjoy going hiking, watching movies, and playing video games. I work as a pizza delivery driver for a local pizza and pub in Oakhurst in East Atlanta. I became interested in coding through friends
        and family.
        I would love a job with competitive pay that allows me to work remotely. My goal is to complete the Georgia Tech
        Coding Bootcamp.
        Then find a job that supports my lifestyle while encouraging me to continue to learn more to become a better
        front end web developer.
    </p>
